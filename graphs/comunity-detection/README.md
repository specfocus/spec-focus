#Community Detection

Connectedness is a core concept of graph theory that enables a sophisticated network analysis such as finding communities. Most real-world networks exhibit substructures (often quasi-fractal) of more or less independent subgraphs.

Connectivity is used to find communities and quantify the quality of groupings. Evaluating different types of communities within a graph can uncover structures, like hubs and hierarchies, and tendencies of groups to attract or repel others. These techniques are used to study emergent phenomena such as those that lead to echo chambers and filter bubble effects.
